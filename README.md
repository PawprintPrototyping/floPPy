This repository contains floPPy, a program designed to be built by [https://justine.lol/ape.html](Cosmopolitian) to be written to 500 floppy disks that Kay got.  Somehow.  Legally.  Don't worry about it.

Just install cosmocc according to the [https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan](directions), add cosmocc to your path, then run make.
