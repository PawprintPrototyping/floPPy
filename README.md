This repository contains floPPy, a program designed to be built by [Cosmopolitian](https://justine.lol/ape.html) to be written to 500 floppy disks that [Kay](https://github.com/kaybarkbark) got.  Somehow.  Legally.  Don't worry about it.

Just install cosmocc according to the [directions](https://github.com/jart/cosmopolitan), add cosmocc to your path, then run make.
